Hello everyone,

I have been following the professional training "Web developer" at [Le Wagon](https://www.lewagon.com/fr) in Nantes :train: !
After this certification (RNCP lvl.6), I wish to continue my studies in apprenticeship.
During thoses 9 weeks, I rediscovered codding and so much more ! I'm always exited in this field where everything is evolving continuously.

You can check the app we made for the final project at Le Wagon [here](https://github.com/qlourenco/Diamond) !
